# median is middle value in our data no matter what (values are sorted)
# if we have even numbers of values we take two value in the middle and take average

# we can handle missing data in sorted values: we can use median
# outlier is a datapoint that is very different from rest of the datapoints
# median is 50th percentile of the dataset that means 50% of the datapoints on the left and the other 50% on the right

# the range between 25th percentile and 75th percentile is called IQR or interquartile range
